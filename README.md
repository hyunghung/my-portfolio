# **Module 2 Challenge**

For this challenge, I was asked to make a portfolio website, basically resembling my resume for those to look at. 
Everything was done from scratch and no code was provided for me, so using "Google" was very beneficial. 
Within this challenge, I added a navigation bar that takes you to the information you want. 

This is what my website looks like right now:

The problems that I encountered was trying to see why I could not add any text to the right of the Navigation bar. 
I wanted to put the phrase "I am a Computer Engineer" on the top so that when people are on my site they 
know instantly what kind of person I am. 

Here is the deployed link:
