# **Module 2 Challenge**

For this challenge, I was asked to make a portfolio website, basically resembling my resune for those to look at. 
Everything was done by scratch and there were not code provided for me to use use, so using "Google" was very beneficial. 
Within this challenge, I added a navagation bar that takes you to the information you want to know. 

This is what my website looks like right now:
